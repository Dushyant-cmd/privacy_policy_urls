Please take a moment to read through these Terms & Conditions. There is some useful information about how to use the forums, our guidelines for behaviour, and how to set up your account and profile.

RULES AT A GLANCE
1. Don’t spam. We have a zero tolerance policy. Do it once and you’re out.
2. Make quality posts. See the Post Quality section below for details.
3. No personal insults​.​ This is self explanatory.
4. Don’t share personal data or any details
5. Whatever the answer of any question,​ KaiseBhi ​is not responsible for any of its consequences.
6. Claim your points after the threshold limit
One account per person
We only allow one account per person please. If you lose access to your account, there’s no need to create another one. Instead, try resetting your password on the login page, or contact an Administrato​r​ for help.
REMEMBER: Search before you post
Nothing fills a forum up with unnecessary content faster than questions that have already been asked and answered many times over. Please search carefully before asking a question to see if it already exists.
Try to discover discussions that are already happening. Please spend some time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own.
Post Quality
   
In order to try to maintain a certain level of quality in discussions here, we ask that you strive to ensure that each post you make is:
● Meaningful​ – says something of substance
● Relevant​ – on topic and helpful, not generic advice
● New​ – something that hasn’t already been said in the thread
Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, please create a New Topic.
The official language here is English and ​all communications should be in English/Hindi please. That’s not because we don’t respect other languages, but because it’s the only language we all understand.
Spam
Often unintentional, sometimes spam is in the eye of the beholder. Try to consider what you’re posting from the moderator’s perspective. If a new member was to join and their very first post is a link back to their own site. That looks very much like spam, and we have a zero tolerance policy.
If you see a topic or reply that you think is spam, please hit the Spam button. Spammers may be warned or banned at our discretion.
What Can’t I Say?
Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:
● Be civil.​ Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.
● Keep it clean.​ Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.
 
● Respect each other.​ Don’t harass or troll anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.
● Keep personal information private.​ All posts in the forums are easily found via search engines, so unless you’re willing to expose your information to the world, please do not post telephone numbers, e-mail addresses etc in your posts.
This is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.
Other things we ask you not to do
Don’t copy and paste whole articles
Don’t post content from other sites. If you want to discuss an article you read somewhere, post a link. (It may also be copyright infringement if you post the whole lot.)
Do Not Offer to Pay for Help
Any thread that offers any service for money can be closed at any time. We are not against paid services but these forums are not the right place for them.
Do Not Offer to Work For Hire
Don’t offer to work for hire in replies on these forums. Help on the forums should be given freely, as in beer.
Social bookmarks
Don’t ask for votes on social bookmarking sites, such as Digg, Reddit, StumbleUpon, or Facebook. We consider this self promotion and it’s not OK.
Piracy, warez, adult sites, and illegal content
 
No sharing of warez or pirated material, please. It is not cool. Likewise, don’t post any work (even a small piece of it) unless you have express permission from the owner or creator of the piece or work. You’ll be responsible for copyright infringement — not us. It is better if you link to it. It will save you some lawyers’ fees!
Additionally, links to adult sites are not allowed.
Affiliate links, coupons, and offers
Affiliate links, coupons, offers are not welcome. DO NOT:
● Post coupon codes, discounts, offers
● Ask for coupons, codes, discounts, invitations to services, etc.
● Post affiliate links. Links to Outwar and similar types of schemes are acceptable, as
these are links to games. However, it should be obvious from the outset where the links lead to.
This is a serious offence that will often earn you an infraction or banning.
Advertising or Soliciting Services
The only advertising that we allow here is for those people looking for someone to do work ​for
them. ​It is not ok to advertise your services​. Keep Our Forum Tidy
Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. So:
● Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.
● Don’t post no-content replies.
 
● Don’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.
● Don’t sign your posts — every post has your profile information attached to it.
● Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, please create a New
Topic.
REMEMBER: Search before you post
Nothing fills a forum up with rubbish faster than questions that have already been asked and answered many times over. Please search carefully before asking a question to see if it already exists.
If You See a Problem, Tell Us
It is the job of the Moderators to ensure that everything is clean and tidy, but there will never be enough moderators to look at every post, so we rely on you to help out. You can do that by alerting us of anything you see that looks off base. It might be a post that’s rude, it might be spam or maybe it’s just in the wrong forum.
In order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts in any way; the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.
The Internet is Forever
Before you post, please think carefully about what you post. These days it’s good business practice to Google your company name every so often to see what people are saying about you.
At Kaise Bhi we accept that occasionally people make silly mistakes and we’ll do everything we can to help you out, but we simply lack the time to edit hundreds of posts and heavy edits or post deletions compromise the flow of a discussion. So please, think first.
 
 Closing or deleting your account
We do not delete accounts. If you’d like your username changed to something that won’t be associated with you, please contact an Administrator.
KaiseBhi’s rights
Kaise Bhi and its assigned agents reserve the right to remove a post that does not relate to the topic being discussed in the forum. In addition, Kaise Bhi reserves the right to organise discussion forums in order to best serve the majority of our members. For example, narrow-interest or minimal activity topics may, at Kaise Bhi’s discretion, be relocated to a more appropriate discussion forum, or deleted entirely.
Kaise Bhi also reserves the right to prohibit or delete discussions that are thought to violate applicable law or that may be harmful to other members, Kaise Bhi, or the rights of Kaise Bhi or others. That said, Kaise Bhi does not have the practical ability to restrict conduct or communications that might violate these Guidelines or the Terms of Service prior to transmission on the Web, nor can we guarantee prompt removal of offending discussion forum posts.
We also reserve the right to remove your membership from the KaiseBhi Forums should you violate Terms & Conditions.
